<p>A barycenter-type of problems is: given a set of objects $\mu_i$,  we are looking for something in that category that is close to those objects with respect to some metric. In our problems, we are particularly interested in the space of probability measures equipped with the Wasserstein distance, which was introduced by Agueh and Carlier [[1]].</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bary}
\mu= \textrm{argmin}\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\lambda_i}{2} W_2^2(\mu_i,\mu).
\end{equation}</p>

<p>They showed it is equivalent to the MMOT under the cost 
\begin{equation}
c(x_1,\cdots,x_m)=\sum_{i&lt;j}\frac{\lambda_i \lambda_j}{2} |x_i-x_j|^2.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>And the Wasserstein barycenter is introduced by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pushforward}
\mu= (\textrm{id} - \frac{\nabla f_i}{\lambda_i})_{\sharp} \mu_i.
\end{equation}</p>
