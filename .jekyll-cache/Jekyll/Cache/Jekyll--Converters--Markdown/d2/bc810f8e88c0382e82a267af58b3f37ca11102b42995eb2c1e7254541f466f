<p>A barycenter-type of problems is: given a set of objects $(\mu_i)_{i=1}^m$, we are looking for something in that category that is close to those objects with respect to some metric. In our problems, we are particularly interested in the space of probability measures equipped with the Wasserstein distance, which was introduced by Agueh and Carlier <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/214446/mb21">1</a>.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bary}
\mu= \textrm{argmin}\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i W_2^2(\mu_i,\mu)
\end{equation}</p>

<!-- B. Zhou and M. Parno are working on a general multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) framework to obtain the continuous representation of discrete-in-time data. Given observations (called as marginals), our algorithm provides a prediction on the sea ice dynamics in a continuous time. This provides a solution to some stage in the [Lagrangian Observation Mapping](https://simda-muri.github.io/challenges/source/descriptions/problem2.html). The python package with its description can be found [here](https://simda-muri.github.io/mmot/).

Using the SAR data (every 6 days) obtained from [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu) on the Robertson Channel (thanks to J. Park), the video shows the prediction dynamics every 2 day. -->
