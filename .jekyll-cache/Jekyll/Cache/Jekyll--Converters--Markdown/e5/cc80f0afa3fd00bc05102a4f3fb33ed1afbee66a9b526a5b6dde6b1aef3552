<p>B. Zhou and M. Parno are working on a general multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) framework to obtain the continuous representation of discrete-in-time data. Given observations (called as marginals), our algorithm provides a prediction on the sea ice dynamics in a continuous time. This provides a solution to some stage in the <a href="https://simda-muri.github.io/challenges/source/descriptions/problem2.html">Lagrangian Observation Mapping</a>. The python package with its description can be found <a href="https://simda-muri.github.io/mmot/">here</a>.</p>

<p>A barycenter-type of problems is: given a set of objects we are looking for something in that category that is close to those objects with respect to some metric. In our problems, we are particularly interested in the space of probability measures equipped with the Wasserstein distance, which was introduced by Agueh and Carlier.</p>
