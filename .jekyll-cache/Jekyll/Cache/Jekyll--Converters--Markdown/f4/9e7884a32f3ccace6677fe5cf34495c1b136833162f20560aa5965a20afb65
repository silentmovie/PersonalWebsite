<p>B. Zhou and M. Parno are working on a general multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) framework to obtain the continuous representation of discrete-in-time data. Given observations (called as marginals), our algorithm provides a prediction on the sea ice dynamics in a continuous time. This provides a solution to some stage in the <a href="https://simda-muri.github.io/challenges/source/descriptions/problem2.html">Lagrangian Observation Mapping</a>. The python package with its description can be found <a href="https://simda-muri.github.io/mmot/">here</a>.</p>
