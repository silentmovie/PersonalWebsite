#### Multimariginal Optimal Transport (MMOT)

MMOT is a natural generalization from 2-marginal classical optimal transport problem to multi-marginals. The famous Wasserstein barycenter problem is an instance of MMOT problems. It can be used in data registrations, data fusion, etc...

Joint with Matt Parno, we introduce an exact and efficient way to compute MMOT with pairwise cost functions. This can be applied in any applications when any pairwise strictly convex relations between marginals are known. 

Our python package description page can be found here [MMOT2D](https://simda-muri.github.io/mmot/).

The application of MMOT on predicting sea ice dynamics can be found in our group page [Lagrangian Mapping](https://simda-muri.github.io/challenges/source/descriptions/problem2.html).
