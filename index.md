### Project Goals

In this MURI project, started in 2020, we seek to develop a computational toolkit that enhances the information we can extract from currently existing environmental data and physical knowledge to improve environmental variables prediction.


Our team consists of five multi-university leading researchers with multi-disciplinary backgrounds, including expertise in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and physics. We are supported by the Department of Defense MURI program through Office of Naval Research (ONR).
