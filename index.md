### About me

I am currently a Byrne Instructor in Applied Mathematics. My mentor is [Prof. Anne Gelb](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~annegelb/). **I am on the job market this year.**

I received my Ph.D in Applied Mathematics in 2020 from the Department of Mathematics, UC Davis, advised by [Prof. Qinglan Xia](http://math.ucdavis.edu/~qlxia). My dissertation topic is **From optimal transport to optimal mixing flows and vice versa**. 

Prior to that, I received my B.S in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in 2014 from Zhejiang University and finished my undergraduate thesis supervised by [Prof. Zhi (George) Lin](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/linzhi/).

Here is my complete [CV]({{site.url}}/CV.pdf). (*Last Update: Oct, 2022*)
