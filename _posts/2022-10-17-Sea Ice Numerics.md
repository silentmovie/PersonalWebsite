New numerical approaches have been developed to improve accuracy, stability, and efficiency in computational modeling of sea ice dynamics. This work enables replacement of current generation algorithms that are slow-converging and potentially unstable with methods that obtain higher-order convergence rates in smooth regions, resolve discontinuities in the sharp features of sea ice covers, and incorporate physical constraints intrinsically without post-processing.

The picture shows the computed solutions (left: velocity, right: ice thickness) of the viscous-plastic sea ice model obtained by reference scheme and newly developed approach.

More details could be found in the manuscript "Improving numerical accuracy for the viscous-plastic formulation of sea ice". This work is done by Tongtong Li, Anne Gelb and Yoonsang Lee, which is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10061) and is submitted in 2022.
