B. Zhou and M. Parno \[[1]\] utilize a general multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) framework to obtain the continuous representation of discrete-in-time data. One possible application is the prediction on the sea ice dynamics. Given observations (called as marginals in the general framework) at different time-stamps, our method provides a prediction on the sea ice dynamics in a continuous time. This provides a solution to some stage in the [Lagrangian Observation Mapping](https://simda-muri.github.io/challenges/source/descriptions/problem2.html). The python package with its description can be found \[[2]\].

Using the SAR data (every 6 days) obtained from [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu) on the Robertson Channel (thanks to our group member J. Park at Dartmouth), the video shows the prediction dynamics every 2 day. Even finer predictions are possible within a few minutes on a personal computer.
