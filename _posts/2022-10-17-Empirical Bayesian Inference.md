Using our multiple measurement vector approach with an empirically-derived mask in the magnitude prior, we sample the posterior distribution of a complex signal. Here, we show the magnitude of an example image recovered in three ways: (left) using just the inverse Fourier transform of the mean of the data, (middle) finding the mean of the magnitude when a nonempirical prior is used, and (right) finding the mean of the magnitude when the empirical prior is used.
